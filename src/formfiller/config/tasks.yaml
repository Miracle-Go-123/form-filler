form_filling_task:
  description: >
    Fill the fields of a given PDF template in JSON format using user-provided answers.
    Each field in the template has a `description` that explains the purpose of the field.
    Your task is to:
    1. Map user answers to the correct fields based on their descriptions.
    2. Return a JSON object containing only `field_key` and `answer` for fields where an answer exists.
    3. Leave out fields without relevant user answers.
    4. Ensure that answers align specifically with the descriptions and do not hallucinate or assume information.

    **User Information**
    {user_response}

    **Form Fields**
    {pdf_form_schema}

    *Rules*
    1) Only include fields where answers have been explicitly provided and are relevant to the fieldâ€™s description.
    2) Check the input type for answer, it should be either string, integer, or boolean. Match the input type according to schema.
    3) Never write wrong field names. It should be exactly same as the field_key in the pdf_form_schema.

    -"field_key": "field_key_from_pdf_form_schema",
    -"answer": "user_provided_answer"
